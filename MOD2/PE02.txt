Before You Start 
•	If you have questions about the lab requirements, please ask a TA to clarify for you.
•	If you are not sure what to do:
1.	Consult the resources listed below.  
2.	If you cannot solve the problem after a few tries, ask a TA for help.

Lab Tasks
•	Write Python programs to complete the given tasks
•	Adding comments is required for all programming exercise problems.



 
Lab Requirement:
1)	prime_number.py
In this lab, we will use the knowledge we learned in Module 1 to print prime numbers. Write a Python program and meet the following requirements:

Note: A prime number can be divided, without a remainder, only by itself and by 1. For example, 17 which is a prime number because it can be divided only by 17 and by 1. Click the following link to get more information about What is a prime number

In your code, you can loop from 2 to n/2 to check whether a given number can be divided without a remainder. (e.g. num % i == 0)

Your program should follow the requirements shown below:

•	The program should ask users to enter a number for the input
•	The program should have a loop to check whether the giving can be divided only by itself and 1
•	The program should give an output to show whether the giving number is a prime number

Example:
Input: 2 
Output: 2 is a prime number
Input: 4 
Output: 4 is not a prime number

2)	Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

•	Fibonacci(0) is 0, Fibonacci(1) is 1
•	The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
•	The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
•	And the 5 is (2+3),
•	and so on!
Input
>>> What position of Fibonacci number you want to see?
>>> 5
Output
>>> 3

3) Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person's stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then: 
•	If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
•	If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
•	If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
•	If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
•	If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
•	If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.


4) A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person's age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

5) Print the following patterns using loop. Do not use direct print statements with multiple stars in a single print statement as shown below. You need to create a set of rules to print the pattern.

print(‘  **  ’)
print(‘   ***   ’)
print(‘    ****    ’)
