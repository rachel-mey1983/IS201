## TP01README

Team Project (TP) (20%)

Project Description: Each team of 2–3 students is required to write a Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) program implemented in Python as a team. There are multiple intermediate submissions based on their progress (please see the details of each submission below). During the game, a user will interact with a computer to play the game. Once a user chooses to play first or second and the label (X or O), then the game begins. As the game progresses, the computer can choose its placement in an empty spot in a random way or using a certain algorithm (e.g. rule-based or minimax algorithm) for an extra point. Your program then displays the board with one of three labels (O, X or predefined position number, and no blank cell please). In each turn, a user knows the available spots to place his/her mark. While the game is being played, your program should monitor the status of the game so that you either proceed for the next turn or to end if there is a winner or draw with appropriate message.

Project Requirements:

Selection of the first player. (e.g., Would you like to play first?)
Assignment of "O" or "X" for a user. (e.g., Please choose 'O' or 'X' for your turn.)
Computer selects a position based on either random position.
If computer can select a position based on an algorithm (e.g., MiniMax algorithm or rule-based) approach, you will earn 20 extra points.
At each run, the program should display the board (3x3) as shown below. Placement is made based on the pre-assigned positional number.
Your program prints an appropriate message if there is a winner and then exits.
Your program saves all the moves between players in a file called tictactoe.txt (X:5 O:2 X:1 O:9 etc...)
Your program should handle incorrect inputs (e.g., input validation) and continue to play without an error.
Submission: There are multiple submissions for TP. Students should upload a pseudocode for overall structure (the flow of logic) in text stating how you approach to implement at high level for choosing a player, displaying a board, monitoring a winner, input validation and file logging for the submission #1. Submission #2 would require a Python code implementation choosing a player and displaying a board at minimum with proper comments (reuse the pseudocode from the earlier submission). This code doesn't need to be run properly, acknowledging that it is a work in progress. The instructor will review what is in the code rather than executing the code necessarily. However, the final submission is expected to run properly without an error. And the final submission includes two parts, (1) a complete Python code meeting all the requirements and (2) a 10-min video presentation. Please note that copying a segment of code from the Internet and submitting it as your work is considered plagiarism.

Submissions:

Submission1: Pseudo-code of overall structures, choosing a player, displaying a board and input validation methods. Define your next activities.

Submission2: Defining the routine that takes turns and processes the input positions and updates the board and your datatypes. Adding file logging routine. Define your next steps.

Submission3 & 4: Final submission (Python code and 10min video presentation)

TP Presentation

The student will report the research outcomes, development, or other project efforts to an academically appropriate committee in a public forum. The nature of the presentation content will determine the specific makeup of the audience. The student will choose the format of the presentation in consultation with the advisor. The layout and design must be appropriate and adequate to represent the outcomes of the effort. While students must make some form of a visual presentation, the presentation of the results may include publishing in a refereed publication, publication in a trade or popular magazine or journal, broadcast in an appropriate medium, or, in exceptional cases, limited dissemination within a closed community.

Each presenter will have 15 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions and answers. Each presenter must keep the total presentation time limit strictly.

The Muddiest Point (MP) (50 Points, 5%)
All classes are required to use the Discussion Board to participate in the Muddiest Point (MP). Participation is an integral part of this course and defined as active engagement in discussing the MP.

Before each week’s class, students are required to submit the Muddiest Point (MP) activity. The purpose of this activity is to stimulate student engagement. The instructor uses the MP to assess how students understood the required readings and to customize the lecture scope to implement Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT). The MP consists of writing a brief reflective essay (<= 50 words) identifying the most confusing part (i.e., the MP) of the content covered in the upcoming module. If a student understands all concepts, the student needs to explain the most exciting aspect.

Although your postings’ tone can be informal, your instructor will expect the content to be professional. Your comments and questions for discussion should be clear and thoughtful, with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The instructor will grade the quality of your discussion postings on both content and response. References for your answers are strongly recommended, and APA is required for references and citations.

There are 10 modules with one Muddiest Point (MP) activity per module, and each MP is worth a total of 5 points. The activity will be graded as follows.

Concept Debate (CD) (50 Points, 5%)
All classes are required to use the Discussion Board to participate in the Concept Debate (CD). Participation is an integral part of this course and defined as active engagement in discussing the CD.

The instructor poses a problem based on the key concepts of a lecture. After reflecting on the problem, students submit their responses, and the instructor reviews them without providing a correct answer. Students discuss their thought process and solution with a peer. Students then commit to an answer and re-submit their responses. Instructor reviews responses and thought processes with the correct answer.

Although your postings’ tone can be informal, your instructor will expect the content to be professional. Your comments and questions for discussion should be clear and thoughtful, with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. As with written assignments, your discussion postings’ quality will be graded on both content and presentation.

There are 10 modules with one Concept Debate (CD) activity per module, and each CD is worth a total of 5 points. The activity will be graded as follows.

Course Policies on topics such as Late Assignments, Participation, and Professional Writing are found Content -> Syllabus, Schedule, and Course Team → Course Policies in the online course menu. Students are responsible for reviewing and applying these policies while enrolled in this course.

University Policies
Students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of CityU’s academic policies. The most current versions of these policies can be found in the University Catalog linked from the CityU Website.

Non-Discrimination & Prohibition of Sexual Harassment
City University of Seattle, its staff and its faculty are deeply committed to supporting our students. We value equity, diversity, and inclusion as a way of life as well as for the educational opportunities it provides. CityU will not tolerate any form of discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identification, socioeconomic status, or religious values. Any student who has experienced discrimination based on the above criteria is encouraged to report this to the University. Students may report an experience of discrimination to their course instructor. If they do not feel safe reporting to their instructor, students may report an experience of discrimination directly to the university Provost or the Vice President of Student Affairs.

CityU adheres to all federal, state, and local civilly rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The University is committed to ensuring that the education environment is bounded by standards of mutual respect and safety and is free from discriminatory practices.

In the U.S., the University is required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to ensure that all of its education programs and activities do not discriminate on the basis of sex/gender. Sex includes sex, sex stereotypes, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, and pregnancy or parenting status. Sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking are forms of sex discrimination, which are prohibited under Title IX and by CityU policy. CityU also prohibits retaliation against any person opposing discrimination or participating in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution. Questions regarding Title IX, including its application and/or concerns about noncompliance, should be directed to the Title IX Coordinator. For more information, visit Title IX Policy and Contact Information.

Religious Accommodations
CityU has a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The University’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available in the University Catalog and on the.cityu.edu student portal. Accommodations must be requested by the 20% mark of this course (e.g., day 14 of a ten-week course, day 7 of a 5-week course) using the Religious Accommodations Request Form found on the student dashboard in the my.cityu.edu student portal.

Academic Integrity

Academic integrity in students requires the pursuit of scholarly activity that is free from fraud, deception and unauthorized collaboration with other individuals. Students are responsible for understanding CityU’s policy on academic integrity and adhering to its standards in meeting all course requirements. A complete copy of this policy can be found in the University Catalog under Student Rights and Responsibilities on the page titled Academic Integrity Policy.

Attendance
Students taking courses in any format at the University are expected to be diligent in their studies and attend class regularly. Regular class attendance/contact is important in achieving learning outcomes in the course and correlates in many cases with participation. As such, it may be a valid consideration in determining the final grade. At the beginning of each course, the instructor will inform students of the relevance of class attendance/contact to the final grade.

Attendance in this class is vital to learning the required course material and demonstrates professionalism and respect for fellow students and the instructor. All students are required to attend every class for the full duration of the class. Arriving late or leaving early will constitute an unexcused absence. It is expected that students who will not be attending or who will be arriving late notify the instructor before class starts.

Excused absences are limited to ILLNESS OR EMERGENCY. Absences related to illness may require verification from a medical doctor. All other absences will be considered unexcused.

In the event of inclement weather, students will be notified by a CityU representative and / or faculty of site closures. As student and faculty safety is a priority, students who feel that driving conditions are unsafe will be permitted an excused absence without a penalty. Students are responsible for notifying the instructor before class starts that they will not be attending class due to inclement weather.

Students with more than 2 unexcused absences will be directed to meet with the local Program Director to discuss continued participation in the course. 3% of students’ overall course grade will be deducted for each unexcused absence.

A complete copy of CityU’s policy can be found in the University Catalog under Student Rights and Responsibilities on the page titled Attendance.

Final Assignment Due Date
Final assignments for each class at CityU must be due on or before the final date of the course as indicated in the university’s course information system. Due dates that extend beyond the final date of the course may negatively impact tuition funding for students.
